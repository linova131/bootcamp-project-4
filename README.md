Project 4 Game Show App
Exceeds Expectations, Style Breakdown

As a part of 'making the project my own', I have changed the overall
color scheme of the app. I believe I have chosen a color scheme that falls
within at least AA WCAG compliance, if not AAA in certain cases. I also
made a modification to the transition time for the QWERTY keys...they
now transition more slowly, because I thought it looked neat...

I have also included an optional prompt at the beginning that asks about
a player's name. If the prompt receives input, a personalized message will
appear at the games completion. If the prompt receives an empty string,
there will still be a message at game completion.
