Project 4 Game Show App
Exceeds Expectations, Style Breakdown

As a part of 'making the project my own', I have changed the overall
color scheme of the app*. I believe I have chosen a color scheme that falls
within at least AA WCAG compliance, if not AAA in certain cases. I also
made a modification to the transition time for the QWERTY keys...they
now transition more slowly, because I thought it looked neat (styles.css, Line 16)...

*(styles.css, Lines 7-12, 89, 113-114, 134, 141, 169,
179, 183, 199. No syntax changes, only #hexdec changes)

I have also included an optional prompt at the beginning (app.js, Line 6) that asks about
a player's name. If the prompt receives input, a personalized message will
appear at the games completion. If the prompt receives an empty string,
there will still be a message at game completion (Game.js, Line 97-107).
